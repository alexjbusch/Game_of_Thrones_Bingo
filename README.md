# Game_of_Thrones_Bingo
A bingo card generator for the game of thrones finale

Click on the exe, (or run the .py file if you're a python user), and your bingo card will pop up.  
Press the "Randomize" button to get a new card.  
Press the "Get a PNG of this card" button to create a screenshot of the card that will appear in a folder called "Bingo_Cards".  Don't worry if you don't have a folder called "Bingo_Cards", it'll appear when you click the button.
Press the "Create new card and get a PNG of it" button to randomize and instantly get a screenshot of a new bingo card.  Press it repeatedly to quickly get multiple random cards without having to press randomize and then press "Get a PNG" again and again.

Use the got_bingo.txt file to view all the possible bingo squares, and feel free to type in your own if you want, just don't add in any empty lines and don't get rid of the asterisks or headings that say "possible deaths", "possible survival", "theories", or "ships".
